# Batch 1 Checklist

## Overview

This batch establishes the foundational structure and core functionality for the Penguin Surf Game. It encompasses Patch 1 which sets up the Nx monorepo workspace, creates the basic 3D game engine, implements physics, and establishes the state management system.

## Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ✅ Scaffold Nx workspace with React web app | Complete | Used `npx create-nx-workspace` with default flags |
| ✅ Add Expo mobile app | Complete | Used `nx g @nx/expo:app mobile --no-interactive` |
| ✅ Create shared libraries (game-engine, types, ui-components, utils) | Complete | Created libs with proper structure |
| ✅ Implement basic 3D rendering with Three.js + React Three Fiber | Complete | Basic scene with penguin, ocean, and environment |
| ✅ Implement physics with @react-three/cannon | Complete | Basic physics for penguin and surfboard |
| ✅ Create Zustand store for game state | Complete | Player state, game modes, and wave data |
| ✅ Implement multiple game modes (surfing, beach, competition) | Complete | State management for different modes |
| ✅ Fix TypeScript and Vite configuration issues | Complete | Resolved path alias and build issues |
| ✅ Scaffold Windsurf documentation files | Complete | guidelines.md, END_GOAL.md, workflows, README |
| ✅ Create patch documentation | Complete | PATCH1_CHECKLIST.md and PATCH1_SUMMARY.md |

## Validation

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| ✅ Project builds cleanly | Pass | `npx nx build web` succeeds |
| ✅ All TypeScript compiles without errors | Pass | No TS errors |
| ✅ Path aliases work correctly | Pass | Module resolution functions |
| ✅ 3D scene renders properly | Pass | Basic scene displays |
| ✅ Physics simulation functions | Pass | Basic physics work |
| ✅ State management works | Pass | Game modes function |
| ✅ Documentation files created per guidelines | Pass | All required files exist |
| ✅ CLI commands used match default flags policy | Pass | Used --no-interactive flags |

## Issues

None identified.

## Next Steps

- Establish atomic component structure and Tailwind config
- Plan systems for penguin customization, beach hut, and surf competitions
- Plan and document VR support (WebXR, Meta Quest, mobile VR)
- Implement penguin customization system
- Develop beach hut functionality
- Create surf competition mechanics
